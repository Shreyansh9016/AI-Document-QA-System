Since we assumed office 12 years ago, India’s economic trajectory \\nhas been marked by stability, fiscal discipline, sustained growth and \\nmoderate inflation. This is the result of conscious choices we have made, \\neven in times of heightened uncertainty and di sruption. Our \\nGovernment, led by Hon’ble Prime Minister Modi, has decisively and \\nconsistently chosen action over ambivalence, reform over rhetoric and \\npeople over populism.  \\n2. We have pursued far reaching structural reforms,  \\nfiscal prudence and monetary stability whilst  \\nmaintaining a strong thrust on public investment.   \\nKeeping atmanirbharta  as a lodestar, we have built domestic \\nmanufacturing capacity, energy security and reduced critical import \\ndependencies.  Simultaneously, we have ensured that citizens benefit \\nfrom every action of the Government, undertaking reforms to support  2  \\n \\nemployment generation, agricultural productivity, household purchasing \\npower and universal services to people.  \\nThese measures have delivered a high growth rate of around 7% and \\nhelped us make substantial strides in poverty reduction and \\nimprovement in the lives of our people.  \\n3. Today, we face an external environment in which trade and \\nmultilateralism are imperilled and access to resources and supply chains \\nare disrupted. New technologies are transforming production systems \\nwhile sharply increasing demands on water, energy and cri tical minerals.  \\n4. India will continue to take confident steps towards Viksit Bharat, \\nbalancing ambition with inclusion. As a growing economy with expanding \\ntrade and capital needs, India must also remain deeply integrated with \\nglobal markets, exporting more and attracting s table long -term \\ninvestment.  \\n \\nPart A  \\n5. As I begin Part A, I want to express my gratitude to the people for \\nstanding firmly with us as we forge our way together towards becoming \\none of the largest economies of the world.  \\n6. Our aim is to transform aspiration into achievement and potential \\ninto performance, as we ensure that the dividends of growth reach every \\nfarmer, the scheduled caste, the scheduled tribes, the nomads, the youth, \\nthe poor and the women.  \\n7. In the Viksit Bharat Young Leaders Dialogue 2026, several \\ninnovative ideas were shared with our Prime Minister, which have \\ninspired many of the proposals, making this a unique Yuva Shakti -driven \\nBudget .  \\n8. Our Government’s ‘Sankalp’ is to focus on our poor, \\nunderprivileged and the disadvantaged . To deliver on this Sankalp, and \\ngiven that this is the first Budget prepared in Kartavya Bhawan, we are \\ninspired by 3 kartavya :  \\n9. Our first kartavya  is to accelerate and sustain economic growth, \\nby enhancing productivity and competitiveness, and building resilience to \\nvolatile global dynamics.   3  \\n \\n10. Our second kartavya  is to fulfil aspirations of our people and build \\ntheir capacity, making them strong partners in India’s path to prosperity.  \\n11. Our third kartavya , aligned with our vision of Sabka Sath, Sabka \\nVikas, is to ensure that every family, community, region and sector has \\naccess to resources, amenities and opportunities for meaningful \\nparticipation.   \\n12. This threefold approach requires a supportive ecosystem. The first \\nrequirement is to sustain the momentum of structural reforms — \\ncontinuous, adaptive, and forward -looking. Second, a robust and \\nresilient financial sector  is central to mobilising savings, allocating capital \\nefficiently and managing risks. Third, cutting -edge technologies, \\nincluding AI applications,  can serve as force multipliers for better \\ngovernance.  \\nReform Express  \\n13. Our Government has undertaken comprehensive economic \\nreforms towards creating employment, boosting productivity and \\naccelerating growth. After the Prime Minister’s announcement on \\nIndependence Day in 2025, over 350 reforms have been rolled out. Th ese \\ninclude  GST simplification, notification of Labour Codes, and \\nrationalisation of mandatory Quality Control Orders. High Level \\nCommittees have been formed and in parallel, the Central Government \\nis working with the State Governments on deregulation and reducing \\ncompliance requirements.  \\n14. The Reform Express is well on its way and will maintain its \\nmomentum to help us fulfil our kartavya.  \\nI now move to the specific proposals.  \\n15. Under our first kartavya to accelerate and sustain economic \\ngrowth , I propose interventions in six areas: i) Scaling up manufacturing \\nin 7 strategic and frontier sectors; ii) Rejuvenating legacy industrial \\nsectors; iii) Creating “Champion MSMEs”; iv) Delivering a powerful push \\nto Infrastructure; v) Ensuring long -term energ y security and stability; and \\nvi) Developing City Economic Regions.  \\n \\n  4  \\n \\nScaling up manufacturing in 7 strategic and frontier sectors:  \\n16. Biopharma  SHAKTI (Strategy for Healthcare Advancement \\nthrough Knowledge, Technology and Innovation) – India’s disease \\nburden is observed to be shifting towards non -communicable diseases, \\nlike diabetes, cancer and autoimmune disorders. Biologic medicines are \\nkey to longevity and quality of life at affordable costs. To develop India as \\na global Biopharma man ufacturing hub, I propose the Biopharma SHAKTI \\nwith an outlay of ₹ 10,000 crores over the next 5 years. This will build the \\necosystem for domestic production of bio logics and biosimilars. The \\nStrategy will include a Biopharma -focused network with 3 new National \\nInstitutes of Pharmaceutical Education and Research (NIPER) and \\nupgrading 7 existing ones. It will also create a network of over 1000 \\naccredited India Clinica l Trials sites. We propose to strengthen the Central \\nDrugs Standard Control Organisation to meet global standards and \\napproval timeframes through a dedicated scientific review cadre and \\nspecialists.  \\n17. India Semiconductor Mission (ISM)  1.0 expanded India’s \\nsemiconductor sector capabilities. Building on this,  \\nwe will launch ISM 2.0  to produce equipment and materials, design full -\\nstack Indian IP, and fortify supply chains. We will also focus on industry -\\nled research and training centres to develop technology and skilled \\nworkforce.  \\n18. The Electronics Components Manufacturing Scheme, launched in \\nApril 2025 with an outlay of ₹22,919 crore, already has investment \\ncommitments at double the target. We propose to increase the outlay to \\n₹40,000 crore to capitalise on the momentum.  \\n19. A Scheme for Rare Earth Permanent Magnets was launched in \\nNovember 2025. We now propose to support the mineral -rich States of \\nOdisha, Kerala, Andhra Pradesh and Tamil Nadu to establish dedicated  \\nRare Earth Corridors  to promote mining, processing, research and \\nmanufacturing.  \\n20. To enhance domestic chemical production and reduce import -\\ndependency, we will launch a  Scheme to support States in establishing 3 \\ndedicated Chemical Parks, through challenge route, on a cluster -based \\nplug -and-play model.   5  \\n \\n21. Strong capital goods  capability is a determinant of productivity \\nand quality across different sectors. Towards building this capacity, I \\npropose the following:  \\n(a) Hi-Tech Tool Rooms will be established by CPSEs at 2 locations \\nas digitally enabled automated service bureaus that locally \\ndesign, test, and manufacture high -precision components at \\nscale and at lower cost.  \\n(b) A Scheme for  Enhancement of Construction and \\nInfrastructure Equipment (CIE) will be introduced to \\nstrengthen domestic manufacturing of high -value and \\ntechnologically -advanced CIE. This can range from lifts in a \\nmulti -story apartment, fire -fighting equipment, large and \\nsmall, to tunnel -boring equipment for building metros and \\nhigh -altitude roads.  \\n(c) I also propose a Scheme for Container Manufacturing to \\ncreate a globally competitive container manufacturing \\necosystem, with a budgetary allocation of ₹10,000 crore over \\na 5 year period.   \\n22. For the labour -intensive Textile Sector , I propose  an Integrated \\nProgramme with  5 sub -parts:  \\n(a) The National Fibre Scheme for self -reliance  \\nin natural fibres such as silk, wool and jute,  \\nman -made fibres, and new -age fibres;  \\n(b) Textile Expansion and Employment Scheme to modernise \\ntraditional clusters with capital support for machinery, \\ntechnology upgradation and common testing and \\ncertification centres;  \\n(c) A National Handloom and Handicraft programme to integrate \\nand strengthen existing schemes and ensure targeted \\nsupport for weavers and artisans;  \\n(d) Tex-Eco Initiative to promote  globally competitive and \\nsustainable textiles and apparels;   6  \\n \\n(e) Samarth 2.0 to modernize and upgrade the textile skilling \\necosystem  through collaboration with industry and academic \\ninstitutions.  \\n23. Further, I propose to set up Mega Textile Parks in challenge mode.  \\nThey can also focus on bringing value addition to technical textiles.   \\n24. I propose to launch the Mahatma Gandhi Gram Swaraj initiative \\nto strengthen khadi, handloom and handicrafts. This will help in global \\nmarket linkage and branding. It will streamline and support training, \\nskilling, quality of process and production. This wi ll benefit our weavers,  \\nvillage industries, One - District – One - Product initiative and rural youth.  \\n25. India has the potential to emerge as a global hub for high quality, \\naffordable sports goods . I propose a dedicated initiative for sports goods \\nthat will promote manufacturing, research and innovation in equipment \\ndesign as well as material sciences.  \\nRejuvenation of Legacy Industrial Clusters  \\n26. I propose to introduce a Scheme to revive 200 legacy industrial \\nclusters to improve their cost competitiveness and efficiency through \\ninfrastructure and technology upgradation.  \\nCreating “Champion SMEs” and supporting micro enterprises:  \\n27. Recognising MSMEs as a vital engine of growth, I propose a three -\\npronged approach  to help them grow as ‘Champions’:  \\nEquity Support  \\n28. I propose to introduce a dedicated ₹10,000 crore  SME Growth \\nFund , to create future Champions, incentivizing enterprises based on \\nselect criteria.  \\n29. I also propose to top up the Self -Reliant India Fund set up in 2021, \\nwith ₹2,000 crore to continue support to micro enterprises and maintain \\ntheir access to risk capital.  \\n  7  \\n \\nLiquidity Support   \\n30. With TReDS, more than ₹7 lakh crore has been made available to \\nMSMEs. T o leverage its full potential, I propose 4 measures: (i) mandate \\nTReDS  as the transaction settlement platform for all purchases from \\nMSMEs by CPSEs, serving as a benchmark for other corporates; (ii) \\nintroduce a credit guarantee support mechanism through CGTMSE for \\ninvoice discounting on TReDS platform; (iii) link GeM with TReDS for \\nsharing information with financiers about government purchases from \\nMSMEs, encouraging cheaper and quicker financing; (iv) introduce TReDS \\nreceivables as asset -backed securities, helping develop a secondary \\nmarket, enhancing liquidi ty and settlemen t of transactions.  \\nProfessional Support  \\n31. Government will facilitate Professional Institutions such as ICAI, \\nICSI, ICMAI to design short -term, modular courses and practical tools to \\ndevelop a cadre of ‘Corporate Mitras’, especially in Tier -II and Tier -III \\ntowns. These accredited para -professionals  will help MSMEs meet \\ncompliance requirements at affordable costs.  \\nInfrastructure  \\n32. During this past decade our Government has undertaken several \\ninitiatives for large -scale enhancement of public infrastructure including \\nthrough new financing instruments such as Infrastructure Investment \\nTrusts ( InVITs) and Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs) and institutions \\nlike NIIF and NABFID. We shall continue to focus on developing \\ninfrastructure in cities with over 5 lakh population (Tier II and Tier III), \\nwhich have expanded to become growth centres.  \\n33. Public capex  has increased manifold from ₹2 lakh crore in  \\nFY2014 -15 to an allocation of ₹11.2 lakh crore in  \\nBE 2025 -26. In FY2026 -27, I propose to increase it to ₹12.2 lakh crore to \\ncontinue the momentum.  \\n34. To strengthen the confidence of private developers regarding \\nrisks during infrastructure development and construction phase, I \\npropose to set up an Infrastructure Risk Guarantee Fund to provide \\nprudently calibrated partial credit guarantees to lenders.    8  \\n \\n35. Over the years, REITs have emerged as a successful instrument for \\nasset monetisation. I propose to accelerate recycling of significant real \\nestate assets of CPSEs  through the setting up of dedicated REITs .  \\n36. To promote environmentally sustainable movement of cargo, I \\npropose to: a) Establish new Dedicated Freight Corridors  connecting \\nDankuni in the East, to Surat in the West; b) o perationalise  20 new \\nNational Waterways  (NW) over next 5 years, starting with NW -5 in \\nOdisha to connect mineral rich areas of Talcher and Angul and industrial \\ncentres like Kalinga Nagar to the Ports of Paradeep and Dhamra. Training \\nInstitutes  will be set up as Regional Centres of Excellence for \\ndevelopment of the required manpower. Thi s will benefit youth in the \\nentire stretch of the waterways to train and acquire skills.  \\nFurther, a ship repair ecosystem  catering to inland waterways will also \\nbe set up at Varanasi and Patna; c) launch a Coastal Cargo Promotion \\nScheme  for incentivising a modal shift from rail and road, to increase the \\nshare of inland waterways and coastal shipping from 6 % to 12 % by 2047.  \\n37. To enhance last -mile and remote connectivity, and promote \\ntourism, I propose to give incentives to indigenize manufacturing of \\nseaplanes. A  Seaplane VGF Scheme will be also be introduced to  provide \\nsupport for operations.  \\nCarbon Capture Utilization and Storage (CCUS)  \\n38. Aligning with the roadmap launched in December 2025, CCUS \\ntechnologies at scale will achieve higher readiness levels in end -use \\napplications across five industrial sectors, including, power, steel, \\ncement, refineries and chemicals .  An outlay of ₹20,000 crore  is proposed \\nover the next 5 years.  \\nCity Economic Regions  \\n39. Cities are India’s engines of growth, innovation, and \\nopportunities. We shall now focus on Tier II and Tier III cities, and even \\ntemple -towns, which need modern infrastructure and basic amenities. \\nThis Budget aims to further amplify the potential of cities  to deliver the \\neconomic power of agglomerations by mapping city economic regions \\n(CER), based on their specific growth drivers.  An allocation of ₹ 5000 \\ncrore per CER over 5 years is proposed for implementing their plans  9  \\n \\nthrough a challenge mode with a reform -cum -results based financing \\nmechanism.   \\n40. In order to promote environmentally sustainable passenger \\nsystems, we will develop seven High -Speed Rail  corridors  between cities \\nas ‘growth connectors’ , namely i) Mumbai -Pune, ii) Pune -Hyderabad, iii) \\nHyderabad -Bengaluru,  iv) Hyderabad -Chennai, v) Chennai -Bengaluru, vi) \\nDelhi -Varanasi, vii) Varanasi -Siliguri.  \\nFinancial Sector  \\n41. The Indian banking sector today is characterised by strong balance \\nsheets, historic highs in profitability, improved asset quality and coverage \\nexceeding 98% of villages in the country. At this juncture, we are well -\\nplaced to futuristically evaluate the me asures needed to continue on the \\npath of reform -led growth of this sector.  \\n42. I propose setting up a “High Level Committee on Banking for \\nViksit Bharat” , to comprehensively review the sector and align it with \\nIndia’s next phase of growth, while safeguarding financial stability, \\ninclusion and consumer protection.  \\n43. The vision for NBFCs for Viksit Bharat  has been outlined with clear \\ntargets for credit disbursement and technology adoption. In order to \\nachieve scale and improve efficiency in the Public Sector NBFCs, as a first \\nstep, it is proposed to restructure the Power Finance Corporation and \\nRural Electrification Corporation.  \\n44. I propose a comprehensive review of the Foreign Exchange \\nManagement (Non -debt Instruments) Rules  to create a more \\ncontemporary, user -friendly framework for foreign investments, \\nconsistent with India’s evolving economic priorities.  \\nCorporate Bond Market  \\n45. I propose to introduce a market making framework with suitable \\naccess to funds and derivatives on corporate bond indices. I also propose \\nto introduce total return swaps on corporate bonds.  \\nMunicipal Bonds  \\n46. To encourage the issuance of municipal bonds of higher value by \\nlarge cities, I propose an incentive of ₹100 crore for a single bond issuance  10  \\n \\nof more than ₹1000 crore. The current scheme under AMRUT which \\nincentivises issuances up to ₹200 crore, will also continue to support \\nsmaller and medium towns.  \\nEase of Doing Business  \\n47. Individual Persons Resident Outside India (PROI) will be permitted \\nto invest in equity instruments of listed Indian companies through the \\nPortfolio Investment Scheme. It is also proposed to increase the \\ninvestment limit for an individual PROI under this sc heme from 5% to \\n10%, with an overall investment limit for all  \\nindividual PROIs to 24%, from the current 10%.  \\nEmerging technologies, including AI  \\n48. 21st Century is technology driven. Adoption of technology is for \\nthe benefit of all people - farmers in the field, women in STEM, youth \\nkeen to upskill and Divyangjan to access newer opportunities. The \\nGovernment has taken several steps to support new technolo gies \\nthrough AI Mission, National Quantum Mission, Anusandhan National \\nResearch Fund, and Research, Development and Innovation Fund.  \\n49. Our second kartavya  is to fulfil aspirations and build capacity. \\nClose to 25 crore individuals have come out of multidimensional poverty \\nthrough a decade of our Government’s sustained and reform -oriented \\nefforts.  \\n50. Our Government has therefore decided to place a renewed \\nemphasis on the Services Sector to provide a pathway to fulfilling \\naspirations of a youthful India, with the following measures.  \\nHigh -Powered ‘Education to Employment and Enterprise’ Standing \\nCommittee  \\n51. I propose to set up a High -Powered ‘Education to Employment \\nand Enterprise’ Standing Committee to recommend measures that focus \\non the Services Sector as a core driver of Viksit Bharat. This will make us \\na global leader in services, with a 10% global share  by 2047. The \\nCommittee will prioritise areas to optimise the potential for growth, \\nemployment and exports.  They will also assess the impact of emerging \\ntechnologies, including AI, on jobs and skill requirements and propose \\nmeasures thereof.   11  \\n \\nCreation of Professionals for Viksit Bharat  \\n52. To create a new range of skilled career pathways for our youth, I \\npropose interventions in the following sectors:  \\nHealth  \\n53.  Existing institutions for Allied Health Professionals (AHPs)  will be \\nupgraded and new AHP Institutions established in private and \\nGovernment sectors. This will cover 10 selected disciplines, including \\noptometry, radiology, anesthesia, OT Technology, Applied Psychology \\nand Behavioural Health and add 100,000 AHPs over the  \\nnext 5 years.  \\n54. A strong Care Ecosystem , covering geriatric and allied care \\nservices will be built. A variety of NSQF -aligned programmes will be \\ndeveloped to train multiskilled caregivers combining core care and allied \\nskills, such as, wellness, yoga and operation of medical and assistive \\ndevic es. In the coming year, 1.5 lakh caregivers will be trained.  \\nHubs for  Medical Value Tourism  \\n55. To promote India as a hub for medical tourism  \\nservices, I propose to launch a Scheme to support States in establishing \\nfive Regional Medical Hubs , in partnership with the private sector. These \\nHubs will serve as integrated healthcare complexes that combine \\nmedical, educational and research facilities. They will have AYUSH \\nCentres , Medical Value Tourism Facilitation Centres and infrastructure \\nfor diagnostics, post -care and rehabilitation. These Hubs will provide \\ndiverse job opportunities for health professi onals including doctors and \\nAHPs.  \\nAYUSH  \\n56. Ancient Indian yoga, already respected in several parts of the \\nworld, was given mass global recognition when Hon’ble PM took it to the \\nUN. Post -COVID, Ayurveda gained a similar global acceptance and \\nrecognition.  \\n57. Exporting quality Ayurvedic products helps farmers who grow the \\nherbs and the youth who process the products. To meet growing global \\ndemand, a few more steps are being taken.   12  \\n \\n58. I propose to (i) set up 3 new All India Institutes of Ayurveda; (ii) \\nupgrade AYUSH pharmacies and Drug Testing Labs for higher standards \\nof certification ecosystem, and make available more skilled personnel; \\n(iii) upgrade the WHO Global Traditional Medicine Centre in Jamnagar to \\nbolster evidence -based research, training and awareness for traditional \\nmedicine.  \\nAnimal Husbandry  \\n59. Livestock contributes close to  16% of farm income, including of \\npoor and marginal households. To scale up availability of veterinary \\nprofessionals  by more than 20,000, I propose to roll out a loan -linked \\ncapital subsidy support scheme for establishment of veterinary and para -\\nvet colleges, veterinary hospitals, diagnostic laboratories and breeding \\nfacilities in the private sector. Collaboration between Indian and foreign \\ninstitutions will also be facilitated.  \\nOrange Economy  \\n60. India’s Animation, Visual Effects, Gaming and Comics (AVGC) \\nsector is a growing industry, projected to require 2 million professionals \\nby 2030. I propose to support the Indian Institute of Creative \\nTechnologies, Mumbai in setting up AVGC Content Creator La bs  \\nin 15,000 secondary schools and 500 colleges.  \\nDesign  \\n61. The Indian design industry is expanding rapidly and yet there is a \\nshortage of Indian designers. I propose to establish through challenge \\nroute, a new National Institute of Design to boost design education and \\ndevelopment in the eastern region of India.  \\nEducation  \\n62. Our Government will support States, through challenge route, in \\ncreating 5 University Townships  in the vicinity of major industrial and \\nlogistic corridors. These planned academic zones will host multiple \\nuniversities, colleges, research institutions, skill centres and residential \\ncomplexes.   13  \\n \\n63. In Higher Education STEM institutions, prolonged hours of study \\nand laboratory work pose some challenges for girl students. Through \\nVGF/capital support, 1 girls’ hostel will be established in every district . \\n64. To promote Astrophysics and Astronomy via immersive \\nexperiences, 4 Telescope Infrastructure facilities  will be set up or \\nupgraded - the National Large Solar Telescope, the National Large Optical -\\ninfrared Telescope, the Himalayan Chandra Telescope and the COSMOS -\\n2 Planetarium.  \\nTourism  \\n65. The Tourism sector has the potential to play a large role in \\nemployment generation, forex earnings and expanding the local \\neconomy.  \\n66. I propose to set up a National Institute of Hospitality  by \\nupgrading the existing National Council for Hotel Management and \\nCatering Technology. It will function as a bridge between academia, \\nindustry and the Government.   \\n67. I also propose a pilot scheme for upskilling 10,000 guides  in 20 \\niconic tourist sites through a standardized,  \\nhigh -quality 12 -week training course in hybrid mode, in collaboration \\nwith an Indian Institute of Management.  \\n68. A National Destination Digital Knowledge Grid will be established  \\nto digitally document all places of significance —cultural, spiritual and \\nheritage. This initiative will create a new ecosystem of jobs for local \\nresearchers, historians, content creators and technology partners.  \\n69. India has the potential and opportunity to offer world -class \\ntrekking and hiking experience. We will develop ecologically sustainable \\n(i) Mountain trails in Himachal Pradesh, Uttarakhand and Jammu and \\nKashmir; Araku Valley in the Eastern Ghats and Podhigai Malai in the \\nWestern Ghats. (ii) Turtle Trails along key nesting sites in the co astal areas  14  \\n \\nof Odisha, Karnataka and Kerala; and (iii) Bird watching trails along the \\nPulikat lake in Andhra Pradesh and Tamil Nadu.  \\n70. Under the visionary leadership of Honorable Prime Minister, we \\nestablished the International Big Cat Alliance in 2024. This year, India is \\nhosting the first ever Global Big Cat Summit, where heads of governments \\nand ministers from 95 range countries will d eliberate on collective \\nstrategies for conservation.  \\nHeritage and Culture Tourism  \\n71. I propose to develop 15 archeological sites including Lothal, \\nDholavira, Rakhigarhi, Adichanallur, Sarnath, Hastinapur, and Leh Palace  \\ninto vibrant, experiential cultural destinations. Excavated landscapes will \\nbe opened to the public through curated walkways .  \\nImmersive storytelling skills and technologies will be introduced to help \\nconservation labs, interpretation centres, and guides.  \\nSports  \\n72. The Sports Sector provides multiple means of employment, \\nskilling and job opportunities. Taking forward the systematic nurturing of \\nsports talent which is set in motion through the Khelo India  \\nprogramme, I propose to launch a Khelo India Mission  to transform the \\nSports sector over the next decade.  \\n73. The Mission will facilitate: a) An integrated talent development \\npathway, supported by training centres (foundational, intermediate and \\nelite levels); b) systematic development of coaches and support staff; c) \\nintegration of sports science and technology; d) competitions and leagues \\nto promote sports culture and provide platforms;  and, e) development of \\nsports infrastructure for training and competition.  \\n74. Our third kartavya  aligns with our vision of Sabka Sath, Sabka \\nVikas towards a Viksit Bharat.  \\n75. This requires targeted efforts for a) Increasing farmer incomes  \\nthrough productivity enhancement and entrepreneurship, with special  15  \\n \\nattention to small and marginal farmers ; b) Empowering Divyangjan \\nthrough access to livelihood opportunities, training and   \\nhigh -quality assistive devices ; c) Empowering the vulnerable to access \\nmental health and trauma care; d) Focus on the Purvodaya States  and \\nthe North -East Region  to accelerate development and employment \\nopportunities.   \\nIncreasing Farmer Incomes  \\n76. Fisheries:  We will undertake initiatives (i) for integrated \\ndevelopment of 500 reservoirs and Amrit Sarovars  \\n(ii) strengthen the fisheries value chain in coastal areas and enable \\nmarket linkages involving start -ups and women -led groups together with \\nFish Farmers Producer Organisations.  \\n77. Animal Husbandry:  To provide quality employment opportunities \\nin rural and peri -urban areas,  we will support the Animal Husbandry \\nSector in  entrepreneurship development through: (a) a Credit -Linked \\nSubsidy Programme (b) scaling -up and modernisation of livestock \\nenterprises (c) enhance creation of livestock, dairy and poultry -focused \\nintegrated -value chains and (d) encourage creation of Livestock Farmer \\nProducers Organisations.  \\n78. High Value Agriculture : To diversify farm outputs, increase \\nproductivity, enhance farmers’ incomes, and create new employment \\nopportunities, we will support high value crops such as coconut, \\nsandalwood , cocoa and cashew  in our coastal areas. Agar trees in North \\nEast and nuts such as, almonds, walnuts and pine nuts in our hilly regions \\nwill also be supported.  \\n79. India is the world’s largest producer of coconuts.  \\nAbout 30 million people, including nearly 10 million farmers, depend on \\ncoconuts for their livelihood. To further enhance competitiveness in \\ncoconut production, I propose a Coconut Promotion Scheme  to increase \\nproduction and enhance productivity through various interventions  16  \\n \\nincluding replacing old and non -productive trees with new \\nsaplings/plants/varieties in major coconut growing States.  \\n80. A dedicated programme is proposed for Indian cashew and cocoa \\nto make India self -reliant in raw cashew and cocoa production and \\nprocessing, enhance export competitiveness and transform Indian  \\nCashew and Indian Cocoa  into premium global brands by 2030.  \\n81. Sandalwood  is closely linked to India’s social and cultural \\nheritage. Our Government will partner with State Governments to \\npromote focused cultivation and post -harvest processing to restore the \\nglory of the Indian Sandalwood ecosystem.  \\n82. To rejuvenate old, low -yielding orchards and expand  \\nhigh -density cultivation of walnuts, almonds and pine nuts , we will \\nsupport a dedicated programme to enhance farmer incomes and in \\nbringing value addition by engaging youth.  \\nBharat -VISTAAR (Virtually Integrated System to Access Agricultural \\nResources)  \\n83. I propose to launch Bharat -VISTAAR —a multilingual AI tool that \\nshall integrate the AgriStack portals and the ICAR package on agricultural \\npractices with AI systems. This will enhance farm productivity, enable \\nbetter decisions for farmers and reduce risk by  providing customised \\nadvisory support.  \\nSHE-Marts for Rural Women -led Enterprises  \\n84. Building on the success of the Lakhpati  Didi Programme, I propose \\nto help women take the next step from  \\ncredit -led livelihoods to being owners of enterprises.  \\nSelf-Help Entrepreneur (SHE) Marts will be set up as community -owned \\nretail outlets within the cluster level federations through enhanced and \\ninnovative financing instruments.   17  \\n \\nEmpowering Divyangjan  \\n85. Divyangjan Kaushal Yojana : IT, AVGC sectors, Hospitality and \\nFood and Beverages sectors offer task -oriented and process -driven roles, \\nwhich are suitable for Divyangjans. We will ensure dignified livelihood \\nopportunities through industry -relevant and customized training specific \\nto each divyang group.  \\n86. Divyang Sahara Yojana : Timely  access to high -quality assistive \\ndevices for all eligible Divyangjans is a fundamental need. I propose to (i) \\nsupport the Artificial Limbs Manufacturing Corporation of India ( ALIMCO) \\nto scale up production of assistive devices, invest in R&D and AI \\nintegration, (ii) strengthen PM Divyasha Kendras and support setting up \\nof Assistive Technology Marts as modern retail -style centres where \\nDivyangjans and senior citizens can see, tr y and purchase assistive \\nproducts.  \\nReaffirming our commitment to Mental Health and Trauma Care  \\n87. There are no  national institutes for mental healthcare in north \\nIndia. We will therefore set up a NIMHANS -2 and also upgrade National \\nMental Health Institutes in Ranchi and Tezpur as Regional Apex \\nInstitutions.  \\n88. Emergencies expose families, particularly the poor and \\nvulnerable, to unexpected expenditure. We will strengthen and increase \\nthese capacities by 50% in District Hospitals by establishing Emergency \\nand Trauma Care Centres.  \\nFocus on the Purvodaya States  and the North -Eastern Region  \\n89. Purvodaya: I propose the development of an integrated East \\nCoast Industrial Corridor with a well -connected node at Durgapur, \\ncreation of 5 tourism destinations in the 5 Purvodaya States, and the \\nprovision of 4,000 e -buses.  \\n90. Buddhist Sites in North -Eastern Region: The  \\nNorth -Eastern Region is a civilizational confluence of Theravada and  18  \\n \\nMahayana/Vajrayana traditions. I propose to launch a Scheme for \\nDevelopment of Buddhist Circuits in Arunachal Pradesh, Sikkim, Assam, \\nManipur, Mizoram and Tripura. The Scheme will cover preservation of \\ntemples and monasteries, pilgrimage interpretation cen ters, connectivity \\nand pilgrim amenities.  \\n16th Finance Commission  \\n91. On 17th November 2025, the 16th Finance Commission submitted \\nits report to the President. As mandated under Article 281 of the \\nConstitution, the Government is to lay the Report along with the \\nExplanatory Memorandum on the Action Taken Report on the \\nrecommendations of the Commission in P arliament. The Government has \\naccepted the recommendation of the Commission to retain the vertical \\nshare of devolution at 41%. As recommended by the Commission, I have \\nprovided ₹1.4 lakh crore to the States for the FY 2026 -27 as Finance \\nCommission Grants. These include Rural and Urban Local Body and \\nDisaster Management Grants.  \\nFiscal Consolidation  \\n92. Government has been delivering on our fiscal commitments \\nconsistently without compromising on social needs. To strive towards \\naccepted standards of fiscal management, in Budget 2025 -26, I had \\nindicated that the Central Government would target reaching a de bt-to-\\nGDP ratio of 50±1 percent by 2030 -31. \\n93. In line with this, the debt -to-GDP ratio is estimated to be 55.6  \\npercent of GDP in BE 2026 -27, compared to 56.1 percent of GDP in RE \\n2025 -26. A declining debt -to-GDP ratio will gradually free up resources \\nfor priority sector expenditure by reducing the outgo on interest \\npayments.  \\n94. One of the main operational instruments for debt targeting is the \\nfiscal deficit. I am happy to inform this august House that I have fulfilled \\nmy commitment made in FY 2021 -22 to reduce fiscal deficit below 4.5 \\npercent of GDP by 2025 -26. In RE 2025 -26, the  fiscal deficit has been  19  \\n \\nestimated at par with BE of 2025 -26 at 4.4 percent of GDP. In line with \\nthe new fiscal prudence path of debt consolidation, the fiscal deficit in BE \\n2026 -27 is estimated to be 4.3 percent of GDP.  \\nRevised Estimates 2025 -26 \\n95. The Revised Estimates of the non -debt receipts  \\nare ₹34 lakh crore   of which the Centre’s net tax receipts  \\nare ₹26.7 lakh crore. The Revised Estimate of the total expenditure is \\n₹49.6 lakh crore, of which the capital expenditure is about  \\n₹11 lakh crore.  \\nBudget Estimates 2026 -27 \\n96. Coming to 2026 -27, the non -debt receipts and the  \\ntotal expenditure are estimated as ₹36.5 lakh crore  \\nand ₹53.5 lakh crore respectively. The Centre’s net tax receipts are \\nestimated at ₹28.7 lakh crore.  \\n97. To finance the fiscal deficit, the net market borrowings from dated \\nsecurities are estimated at ₹11.7 lakh crore. The balance financing is \\nexpected to come from small savings and other sources. The gross market \\nborrowings are estimated at ₹17.2 lakh crore.   \\nI will now move to Part B.   20  \\n \\nPART B  \\nDirect Taxes  \\nSpeaker Sir,  \\n98. Now I present my proposals on Direct Taxes.  \\nNew Income Tax Act  \\n99. In July 2024, I announced a comprehensive review of the \\nIncome Tax Act, 1961. This was completed in a record time and the \\nIncome Tax Act, 2025 will come into effect from 1st April, 2026.   \\n100. The simplified Income Tax Rules and Forms will be notified \\nshortly, giving adequate time to taxpayers to acquaint themselves \\nwith its requirements . \\n101. The forms have been redesigned such that ordinary citizens \\ncan comply without difficulty.  \\nEase of Living  \\n102. I propose that any interest awarded by the  \\nMotor Accident Claims Tribunal  to a natural person will be exempt \\nfrom Income Tax, and any TDS on this account will be done away \\nwith . \\n103. I propose to reduce TCS rate on the sale of overseas tour \\nprogram package from the current 5 percent  \\nand 20 percent to 2 percent without any stipulation of amount.  \\n104. I propose to reduce TCS rate for pursuing education and for \\nmedical purposes under the Liberalized Remittance Scheme (LRS) \\nfrom 5 percent to 2 percent.  \\n105. Supply of manpower services is proposed to be specifically \\nbrought within the ambit of payment to contractors for the purpose \\nof TDS to avoid ambiguity. Thus, TDS on these services will be at the \\nrate of either 1 percent or 2 percent only.  \\n106. I propose a scheme for small taxpayers wherein  \\na rule -based automated process will enable obtaining a lower or nil \\ndeduction certificate instead of filing an application with the \\nassessing officer.   21  \\n \\n107. For the ease  of taxpayers holding securities in multiple \\ncompanies, I propose to enable depositories to accept Form 15G or \\nForm 15H from the investor and provide it directly to various relevant \\ncompanies.  \\n108. I propose to extend time available for revising returns from \\n31st December to up to 31st March with the payment of a nominal \\nfee.   \\n109. I also propose to stagger the timeline for filing of tax returns. \\nIndividuals with ITR 1 and ITR 2 returns will continue to file till 31st \\nJuly and non -audit business cases or trusts are proposed to be \\nallowed timetill 31st August.  \\n110. TDS on the sale of immovable property by a  \\nnon-resident is proposed to be deducted and deposited through \\nresident buyer’s PAN based challan instead of requiring TAN.  \\n111. To address practical issues of small taxpayers like students, \\nyoung professionals, tech employees, relocated NRIs, and such \\nothers, I propose to introduce a one -time 6 -month foreign asset \\ndisclosure scheme for these taxpayers to disclose income or assets \\nbelow a certain size.  \\n112. This scheme would be applicable for two categories of \\ntaxpayers namely,  \\n(A) who did not disclose their overseas income or asset and  \\n(B) who disclosed their overseas income and/or paid due tax, but \\ncould not declare the asset acquired.  \\nFor category (A), the limit of undisclosed income/asset is proposed to \\nbe up to 1 crore rupees.  They need to pay 30 percent of Fair Market \\nValue of asset or 30 percent of undisclosed income as tax and 30 \\npercent as additional income tax in lieu of penalty  and would thereby \\nget immunity from prosecution.  \\nFor category (B), asset value is proposed to be  \\nup to 5 crore rupees. Here, immunity from both penalty and \\nprosecution will be available with the payment of fee  \\nof 1 lakh rupees.   22  \\n \\nRationalizing Penalty and Prosecution  \\n113. Multiplicity of proceedings are a hindrance to the ease of \\ndoing business. I propose to integrate assessment & penalty \\nproceedings by way of a common order for both. There will be no \\ninterest liability on the taxpayer on the penalty amount for the period \\nof appeal before the first appellate authority irrespective of the \\noutcome of appeal proc ess. Further, quantum of pre -payment is \\nbeing reduced from 20 percent to 10 percent and will continue to be \\ncalculated only on core tax demand.  \\n114. As an additional measure for reducing litigation,  \\nI propose to allow taxpayers to update their returns even after \\nreassessment proceedings have been initiated, at an additional 10 \\npercent tax rate over and above the rate applicable for the relevant \\nyear. The assessing officer will then use only this updat ed return in \\nhis proceedings.  \\n115. There is already a framework for immunity from penalty and \\nprosecution in the cases of underreporting. I propose to apply this \\nframework of immunity to misreporting  too. However, in such a case \\nthe taxpayer will need to pay 100 percent of the tax amount as an \\nadditional income tax over and above the tax and interest due.  \\n116. Penalties for certain technical defaults such as failure to get \\naccounts audited, non -furnishing of transfer pricing audit report and \\ndefault in furnishing statement for financial transactions, are \\nproposed to be converted into fee.  \\n117. I propose to rationalise prosecution framework under the \\nIncome Tax Act while maintaining a careful balance for deterrence in \\nsome serious offences.  \\n118. Non-production of books of account and documents, and \\nrequirement of TDS payment, where payment is made in kind, are \\nbeing decriminalised. Further, minor offences will attract fine only.  \\n119. The remaining prosecutions will be graded commensurate \\nwith the quantum of offence. They will entail only simple \\nimprisonment, with maximum imprisonment reduced to two years, \\nand power to courts to convert even those into fine.   23  \\n \\n120. There is no penalty presently for non -disclosure of non -\\nimmovable foreign assets with aggregate value less than 20 lakh \\nrupees. I propose to also provide them with immunity from \\nprosecution with retrospective effect from 1.10.2024.  \\nCooperatives  \\n121. Deduction is already allowed to a primary cooperative society \\nengaged in supplying milk, oilseeds, fruits or vegetables raised or \\ngrown by its members. I propose to extend this deduction to also \\ninclude supply of cattle feed and cotton seed produced by its  \\nmembers.  \\n122. I propose to allow inter -cooperative society dividend income \\nas deduction under the new tax regime to the extent it is further \\ndistributed to its members.  \\n123. I further propose to allow exemption for a period  \\nof 3 years, to dividend income received by a notified national co -\\noperative federation, on their investments made in companies up to \\n31.1.2026. This exemption would be allowed only for dividends \\nfurther distributed to its member co -operatives.  \\nSupporting IT sector as India’s growth engine  \\n124. India is a global leader in software development services, IT \\nenabled services, knowledge process outsourcing services and \\ncontract R&D services relating to software development. These \\nbusiness segments are quite inter -connected with each other.  \\n125. All these services are proposed to be clubbed under a single \\ncategory of Information Technology Services  \\nwith a common safe harbour margin of 15.5 percent applicable to all.  \\n126. The threshold for availing safe harbour for IT services is being \\nenhanced substantially from 300 crore rupees to 2,000 crore rupees.  \\n127. Safe harbour for IT services shall be approved by an \\nautomated rule -driven process without any need for tax officer to \\nexamine and accept the application. Once applied by an IT Services \\ncompany, the same safe harbour can be continued for a period of 5 \\nyear s at a stretch at its choice.   24  \\n \\n128. For IT services companies who want to conclude Advance \\nPricing Agreement (APA), I propose to fast track Unilateral APA \\nprocess for IT services and endeavour to conclude it within a period \\nof 2 years. The period of 2 years can be extended by a further perio d \\nof 6 months on taxpayer’s request.  \\n129. I propose to extend the facility of modified returns available \\nto the entity entering APA to its associated entities also.  \\nAttracting global business and investment  \\n130. Recognising the need to enable critical infrastructure and \\nboost investment in data centres, I propose to provide tax holiday till \\n2047 to any foreign company that provides cloud services to \\ncustomers globally by using data centre services from India. It wi ll, \\nhowever, need to provide services to Indian customers through an \\nIndian reseller entity.  \\n131. I also propose to provide a safe harbour of 15 percent on cost \\nin case the company providing data centre services from India is a \\nrelated entity.  \\n132. To harness the efficiency of just -in-time logistics for electronic \\nmanufacturing, I propose to provide safe harbour to non -residents \\nfor component warehousing in a bonded warehouse at a profit \\nmargin of 2 percent of the invoice value. The resultant tax of about \\n0.7 percent will be much lower than in competing jurisdictions.  \\n133. To provide fillip to toll manufacturing in India,  \\nI propose to provide exemption from income tax  \\nfor 5 years, to any non -resident who provides capital goods, \\nequipment or tooling, to any toll manufacturer in a bonded zone.  \\n134. To encourage vast pool of global talent to work in India for a \\nlonger period of time, I propose to provide exemption to global (non -\\nIndia sourced) income of a non -resident expert, for a stay period of 5 \\nyears under notified schemes.  \\n135. I propose to provide exemption from Minimum Alternate Tax \\n(MAT) to all non -residents who pay tax on presumptive basis.  \\n  25  \\n \\nTax administration  \\n136. I propose to constitute a Joint Committee of Ministry of \\nCorporate Affairs and Central Board of Direct Taxes for incorporating \\nthe requirements of Income Computation and Disclosure Standards \\n(ICDS) in the Indian Accounting Standards (IndAS) itself. Separate \\naccounting requirement b ased on ICDS will be done away with from \\nthe tax year 2027 -28. \\n137. To support PM Modi’s vision of home -grown accounting and \\nadvisory firms to become global leaders, I propose to rationalise the \\ndefinition of accountant for the purposes of Safe Harbour Rules.  \\nOther Tax proposals  \\n138. Change in taxation of buyback was brought in to address the \\nimproper use of buyback route by promoters. In the interest of \\nminority shareholders, I propose to tax buyback for all types of \\nshareholders as Capital Gains. However, to disincentivize misuse of \\ntax arbitrage, promoters will pay an additional buyback tax. This will \\nmake effective tax 22 percent for corporate promoters. For non -\\ncorporate promoters the effective tax will be 30 percent.  \\n139. TCS rate for sellers of specific goods namely alcoholic liquor, \\nscrap and minerals will be rationalized to 2 percent and that on tendu \\nleaves will be reduced from 5 percent to 2 percent.  \\n140. I propose to raise the STT on Futures to 0.05 percent from \\npresent 0.02 percent. STT on options premium and exercise of \\noptions are both proposed to be raised to 0.15 percent from the \\npresent rate of 0.1 percent and 0.125 percent respectively .  \\n141. We reformed the taxation landscape for corporates in 2019 \\nby providing them a simplified regime with lower tax rate so that they \\ncould productively focus on business rather than on claim of \\ndeductions and exemptions.  \\n142. To encourage companies to shift to the new regime, set -off of \\nbrought forward MAT credit is proposed to be allowed to companies \\nonly in the new regime. Set -off using available MAT credit is proposed \\nto be allowed to an extent of 1/4th of the tax liability in the new \\nregime.   26  \\n \\n143. MAT is proposed to be made final tax. So, there will be no \\nfurther credit accumulation from 1st April 2026.  \\nIn line with this change, the rate of final tax is being reduced to 14 \\npercent from the current MAT rate  \\nof 15 percent. The brought forward MAT credit of taxpayers \\naccumulated till 31st March 2026, will continue to be available to \\nthem for set -off as above.  \\n \\nIndirect Taxes  \\n144. I shall now take  up proposals related to Indirect Taxes. My \\nproposals for Customs and Central Excise  \\naim to further simplify the tariff structure, support domestic \\nmanufacturing, promote export competitiveness, and correct \\ninversion in duty.  \\n \\nReview of exemptions and tariff simplification  \\n145. To continue weeding out long continuing customs duty \\nexemptions, I propose to remove certain exemptions on items which \\nare being manufactured in India or where the imports are negligible. \\nSimilarly, to further simplify the process of ascertaining the rate of \\nduty applicable on a particular item, I propose to incorporate certain \\neffective rates in various customs notifications  to the tariff schedule \\nitself.  \\n146. I shall now take  up sector specific proposals.  \\nPromotion of exports of marine, leather, and textile products  \\n147. I propose  to increase the limit for duty -free imports of \\nspecified inputs used for processing seafood products for export, \\nfrom the current 1 per cent to 3 per cent of the FOB value of the \\nprevious year’s export turnover.  \\n148. I also propose to allow duty -free imports of specified inputs, \\nwhich is currently available for exports of leather or synthetic \\nfootwear, to exports of Shoe Uppers as well.   27  \\n \\n149. I propose to e xtend the time period for export of final product \\nfrom the existing 6 months to 1 year, for exporters of leather or \\ntextile garments, leather or synthetic footwear and other leather \\nproducts.  \\nEnergy transition and security  \\n150. I propose to extend the basic customs duty exemption given \\nto capital goods used for  manufacturing Lithium -Ion Cells for \\nbatteries, to those used for manufacturing Lithium -Ion Cells for \\nbattery energy storage systems too.  \\n151. I propose to  exempt basic customs duty on import of sodium \\nantimonate for use in manufacture of solar glass.  \\nNuclear Power  \\n152. I propose to e xtend the existing basic customs duty \\nexemption on imports of goods required for Nuclear Power Projects \\ntill the year 2035 and expand it for all nuclear plants irrespective of \\ntheir capacity.  \\nCritical Minerals  \\n153. It is proposed to provide basic customs duty exemption to the \\nimport of capital goods required for processing of critical minerals in \\nIndia.   \\nBiogas blended CNG  \\n154. I propose to exclude the entire value of biogas  \\nwhile calculating the Central Excise duty payable on biogas blended \\nCNG.  \\nCivil and Defence Aviation  \\n155. I propose to exempt basic customs duty on components and \\nparts required for the manufacture of civilian, training and other \\naircrafts.  \\n156. It is proposed to exempt basic customs duty on raw materials \\nimported for manufacture of parts of aircraft to be used in \\nmaintenance, repair, or overhaul requirements by Units in the \\nDefence sector.   28  \\n \\nElectronics  \\n157. To deepen value addition in the consumer electronics sector, \\nI propose to exempt basic customs duty on specified parts used in the \\nmanufacture of microwave ovens.  \\nSpecial Economic Zone  \\n158. To address the concerns arising about utilization of capacities \\nby manufacturing units in the Special Economic Zones due to global \\ntrade disruptions, I propose, as a special one -time measure,  \\nto facilitate sales by eligible manufacturing units in SEZs to the \\nDomestic Tariff Area (DTA) at concessional rates of duty. The quantity \\nof such sales will be limited to a prescribed proportion of their \\nexports. Necessary regulatory changes will be undert aken to \\noperationalise these measures while ensuring level -playing field for \\nthe units working in the DTA.  \\nEase of Living  \\n159. To rationalize the customs duty structure for goods imported \\nfor personal use, I propose to reduce the tariff rate on all dutiable \\ngoods imported for personal use from 20 per cent to 10 per cent.  \\n160. To provide relief to patients, particularly those suffering from \\ncancer, I propose to exempt basic customs duty on 17 drugs or \\nmedicines.  \\n161. I also propose to \\u2060add 7 more rare diseases for the purposes of \\nexempting import duties on personal imports of drugs, medicines \\nand Food for Special Medical Purposes (FSMP) used in their \\ntreatment.   \\nCustoms Process  \\n162. India\\'s role and share in global trade is poised for a major leap, \\nin line with our ambition and journey towards \\'Viksit Bharat\\' . In this \\nregard, I propose many measures  for custom processes to have \\nminimal intervention for smoother and faster movement  \\nof goods and greater certainty to the trade.   29  \\n \\nTrust -based systems  \\n163. I propose to enhance duty deferral period for  \\nTier 2 and Tier 3 Authorised Economic Operators, known as AEOs, \\nfrom 15 days to 30 days.  \\n164. I propose to provide eligible manufacturer -importers the \\nsame duty deferral facility. This should encourage them to get \\nthemselves accredited as a full -fledged Tier 3 - AEO in due course.  \\n165. To provide greater certainty and for better business planning, \\nI propose to extend validity period of advance ruling, binding on \\nCustoms, from the present 3 years to 5 years.  \\n166. In the spirit of whole -of-the-government approach, \\nGovernment agencies will be encouraged to leverage AEO \\naccreditation for preferential treatment in clearing their cargo.  \\n167. Regular importers with trusted longstanding supply chains \\nwill be recognized in the  risk system, so that the need for verification \\nof their cargo every time can be minimized. Export cargo using \\nelectronic sealing will be provided through clearance from the factory \\npremises to the ship.  \\n168. For import of goods not needing any compliance, filing of bill \\nof entry by a trusted importer, and arrival of goods will automatically \\nnotify Customs for completing their clearance formalities. This will \\nenable goods to be released immediately on arrival.  \\n169. The Customs warehousing framework will be transformed \\ninto a warehouse operator -centric system with self -declarations, \\nelectronic tracking and risk -based audit. These reforms will move \\naway from the current system of officer -dependent approvals, and  \\nreduce transaction delays and compliance costs.  \\n  30  \\n \\nEase of Doing Business  \\n170. Approvals required for cargo clearance from various \\nGovernment agencies will be seamlessly processed through a single \\nand interconnected digital window by the end of the financial year. \\nProcesses involved in clearance of food, drugs, plant, animal & wild \\nlife products, accounting for around 70 percent of interdicted cargo, \\nwill be operationalised on this system by April 2026 itself.  \\n171. For goods not having any compliance requirement, clearance \\nwill be done by Customs  immediately after online registration is \\ncompleted by the importer, subject to the payment of duty.  \\n172. Customs Integrated System (CIS) will be rolled out  \\nin 2 years as a single, integrated and scalable platform for all the \\ncustoms processes.   \\n173. Utilization of non -intrusive scanning with advanced imaging \\nand AI technology for risk assessment will be expanded in a phased \\nmanner with  the objective to scan every container across all the \\nmajor ports.  \\nNew export opportunities  \\n174. To support Indian  fishermen to fully harness the economic value \\nof marine resources beyond our territorial waters, the following measures \\nwill be taken.  \\na. Fish catch by an Indian fishing vessel in Exclusive Economic Zone \\n(EEZ) or on the High Seas will be made free of duty.  \\nb. Landing of such fish on foreign port will be treated as export of \\ngoods.  \\nSafeguards will be put in place to prevent misuse during fish catch, transit \\nand transshipment.   31  \\n \\n175. To support aspirations of India’s small businesses, artisans and \\nstart -ups to access  global markets through e -commerce , I am pleased to \\nannounce complete removal of the current value cap of ₹10 lakh per \\nconsignment on courier exports. In addition, handling of rejected and \\nreturned consignments will be improved with effective use of technology \\nfor identifying such consignm ents.  \\nEase of Living  \\n176. I propose to revise provisions governing baggage clearance during \\ninternational  travel to address genuine concerns of passengers. The \\nrevised rules will enhance duty -free allowances in line with the present -\\nday travel realities and provide clarity in temporary carriage of goods \\nbrought in or taken out.  \\n177. There are honest taxpayers who are willing to settle disputes by \\npaying all their dues. But they get deterred due to negative connotation \\nassociated with penalty. They will now be able close cases by paying an \\nadditional amount in lieu of penalty.  \\nHonourable Speaker Sir, with this, I commend the Budget to this august \\nHouse.  \\nJai Hind!  \\n  32  \\n \\nAnnex ure to Part A  \\n \\nIndicative Terms of Reference of the High -Level Education -to-Employment \\nand Enterprise Standing Committee  \\ni. identify services  sub-sectors with potential for growth, \\nemployment and exports , identify sector -specific gaps and \\nmeasures to unlock employment potential;  \\nii. identify c ross-sectoral policy and regulatory issues, including \\nstandards -setting and accreditation;   \\niii. examine areas for services export;  \\niv. assess t he impact of emerging technologies, including AI, on  jobs \\nand skill requirements;  \\nv. propose specific  measures for embedding AI in the  education \\ncurriculum from school level onwards and upgrading State \\nCouncils of Educational Research and Training institutes  for \\nteacher training;  \\nvi. propose measures for upskilling and re -skilling of technology \\nprofessionals/engineers in AI and emerging technologies; and  \\nvii. Propose measures for AI enabled matching of worders, jobs and \\ntraining opportunities; and  \\nviii. propose measures to make the informal workflow visible, \\nverifiable and future -ready, to enhance upward mobility \\nprospects; and  \\nix. propose steps to be taken to attract skilled diaspora and foreign \\ntalent into the country.  \\n \\n \\n \\n  33  \\n \\nAnnexure to Part B  \\nAmendments relating to Direct Taxes  \\n1. EASE OF LIVING  \\n(i) Exemption of interest on compensation amount awarded by Motor \\nAccident Claims Tribunal (MACT)  \\n\\uf0b7 In order to alleviate the sufferings of victims of motor vehicle \\naccident and their family, it is proposed that any interest awarded \\non compensation amount in the case of individual awarded by \\nMACT shall be exempt.  \\n\\uf0b7 It is also proposed that in case of an individual, no tax shall be \\ndeducted at source for such interest, irrespective of the amount \\nof interest awarded by MACT.  \\n(ii) Removal of ambiguity on the application of rate of TDS on account \\nof supply of manpower  \\n\\uf0b7 It is proposed to include supply of manpower within the definition \\nof “work” under section 402(47) of the Income -tax Act, 2025 so as \\nto provide that tax on such supply of manpower shall be deducted \\nat source as “payment to contractors” under the provisions  of \\nsection 393(1) [Table: Sl. No. 6(i) and (ii)] and not under the \\nprovisions of “fee for professional services” under section 393(1) \\n[Table: Sl. No. (iii)].  \\n(iii) Enabling electronic verification and issuance of certificate for \\ndeduction of income -tax at lower rate or no deduction of income -tax \\n\\uf0b7 It is proposed to ease the compliance burden of small taxpayers \\nby providing an online option to the payee, to apply for issuance \\nof certificate for lower or nil deduction of income -tax which is \\nproposed to be issued online after electronic verification.  \\n(iv) Enabling filing of declaration for no deduction of tax at source under \\nsection 393(6) of the Income -tax Act, 2025 to the depository  \\n\\uf0b7 It is proposed to allow filing of the declaration by a taxpayer for \\nno deduction of tax at source, to a depository, where income is of  34  \\n \\nthe nature: (i) income from units of a mutual fund (ii) interest \\nincome from securities and (iii) dividends . This will address the \\npresent requirements of an investor to file separate declaration \\nto different payers.

RATIONALISING PENALTY AND PROSECUTION  \\n(i) Reduction in multiplicity of proceedings  \\n\\uf0b7 Presently, penalty proceedings are initiated after completion of \\nthe assessment proceedings. This takes a long time for finalising \\nissues emerging out of any assessment. Multiplicity of \\nproceedings increases number of pending appeals, cost of \\nlitigation an d compliance. With a view to provide fast -track  36  \\n \\nsettlement of disputes, it is proposed to integrate assessment & \\npenalty proceedings by way of a common order after providing \\nreasonable opportunity to the taxpayer to explain the issue.  \\n\\uf0b7 To provide relief to taxpayers on account of increase in quantum \\nof demand which may arise as a result, it is proposed that the \\ninterest on penalty would be kept in abeyance during the \\npendency of appeal before first appellate authority.  \\n(ii) Immunity from penalty from underreporting in consequence of \\nmisreporting of income and prosecution in such cases  \\n\\uf0b7 There are broadly two kind of penalties –  \\n(i) underreporting of income due to mistakes or oversight \\nwhere penalty is 50% on tax amount and framework to \\nunderreporting of income in consequence of misreporting \\nof income     \\n(ii) underreporting in consequence of misreporting of income \\non account of giving wrong or faulty information or \\nmisrepresenting the type of income where the penalty is \\n200% on tax amount.  \\nThere is already a framework for immunity from penalty and \\nprosecution, under section 478 and 479 of the Act, if the penalty is \\ninitiated for underreporting of income. In this regard, it is proposed \\nto extend the same on payment of 100% of tax amount as \\nadditional income -tax. However, the misreporting of income in \\nrespect of unexplained cash credit, etc. is proposed to be settled \\nwith a payment of 120% of the tax. In such cases immunity shall not \\nbe granted where prosecution is initiated as per provision of  \\nchapter -XXII of the Act.  \\n(iii) Conversion of penalty to fee  \\n\\uf0b7 It is proposed to convert  \\n(i) penalty for failure to get accounts audited,  \\n(ii) penalty for non -furnishing of TP report and   37  \\n \\n(iii) penalty for default in furnishing statement for financial \\ntransactions or reportable accounts into fee to be charged per \\nday of the default subject to a maximum ceiling.  \\n(iv) Rationalization of the prosecution framework  \\n\\uf0b7 It is proposed that production of books of account and \\ndocuments, and requirement of ensuring payment of TDS from \\nthe deductee where payment is made in kind, be completely \\ndecriminalised.  \\n\\uf0b7 It is further proposed that all prosecutions shall be rationalised to \\nsimple imprisonment instead of rigorous imprisonment.  \\n\\uf0b7 Maximum punishment for any offence (except for repeated \\noffence) is proposed to be reduced to 2 years instead of 7 years.  \\n\\uf0b7 In cases where presently the maximum punishment is two years, \\nthe punishment has been reduced to 6 months with or without \\nfine and with no minimum imprisonment.  \\n\\uf0b7 It is further proposed that prosecution for the offences under \\nIncome -tax Act, 2025 shall be based on the amount of tax evaded \\nand the punishment shall be proportionate to the gravity of crime. \\nIn such cases, the requirement of maximum punishment of \\nimpris onment has been done away with apart from relaxing the \\nrequirement of mandatory fine to optional.  \\n\\uf0b7 It is further proposed, for minor offence, only fine shall be \\nprovided as a punishment.  \\n(v) Rationalising the tax rate for special income charged under section \\n195 of the Act  \\n\\uf0b7 Presently there is special tax rate on certain incomes like income \\nin the nature of cash credits, unexplained investments, etc. The \\ntax rate is 60% and penalty is 10% of tax. It is proposed to \\nrationalise the tax rate to 30% on these incomes. Penalty on su ch \\namount would be merged with penalty for underreporting of \\nincome in consequence of misreporting of income that is 200% of \\ntax amount.   38  \\n \\n(vi) Relaxation of search assessment in case of person other than the \\nsearched person in certain situation  \\n\\uf0b7 Provisions for assessment in search cases was introduced by \\nFinance (No. 2) Act, 2024.  In the new scheme, where \\nincriminating material pertaining to other person, relates only to \\na single tax year, the other person is also required to undergo the \\nfull blo ck assessment procedure, resulting in an increased \\ncompliance burden on such person against whom no search or \\nrequisition was initiated.  \\n\\uf0b7 It is proposed to limit the period of block in case of other person, \\nwhere the undisclosed income of the other person pertains only \\nto one tax year. The definition of block period is accordingly \\nproposed to be amended in such cases.  \\n(vii) Time limit to complete search assessment  \\n\\uf0b7 It is also proposed to amend section 296 of the Income -tax Act, \\n2025  so as to take the date of initiation of search as the reference \\npoint to decide the date of limitation for block assessment and \\nconsequently, the period of twelve months is proposed to be \\nextended to eighteen months in the case of specified person.  \\n(viii) Extending the scope of filing of updated return  \\n\\uf0b7 There is facility for updating tax returns where the taxpayer wants \\nto show any additional income. This facility is available for a \\nperiod of 4 years for an additional tax liability of 25%, 50%, 60%, \\n70% from the first to the fourth year after the relevant  tax year \\nwhen the return of income required to be filed for the first time. \\nTo provide additional measure for reducing litigation, it is \\nproposed to allow the taxpayer to update the return even after \\nreassessment proceedings have been initiated. The updat ion is \\nproposed to be enabled at an additional 10% tax rate over and \\nabove the rate applicable for relevant year.   39  \\n \\n\\uf0b7 It is further proposed to allow filing of updated return in cases \\nwhere tax payer reduces the amount of loss filed in original return \\nunder section 263(1).  \\n\\uf0b7 It is further proposed that where the taxpayer files updated return \\nand reports additional income then penalty shall not be leviable \\non such additional income.  \\n(ix) Immunity from prosecution under the Black Money Act  \\n\\uf0b7 Under the Black Money (Undisclosed Foreign Income and Assets) \\nand Imposition of Tax Act, 2015, there is no penalty for non -\\ndisclosure of non -immovable assets with aggregate value less \\nthan twenty lakh rupees. It is proposed to extend this immunity \\nfor pros ecution in such cases with retrospective effect from \\n1.10.2024.  \\n(x) Penalty provision for non -furnishing of statement or furnishing \\ninaccurate information in a statement on transaction of crypto -assets  \\n\\uf0b7 To ensure compliance to the provisions of section 509 of the \\nIncome -tax Act, 2025  and create a deterrence for non -furnishing \\nof statement or for furnishing inaccurate information in respect of \\ncrypto assets in such statement, it is proposed to introduce \\npenalty provision. Penalty of Rs. 200 per day for non -furnishing of \\nstatement and R s. 50,000 for furnishing inaccurate particulars and \\nfailure to correct such inaccuracy is proposed to be levied.  \\n3.

Non -allowance of this deduction in the new tax regime \\nmay result in double taxation as it may be taxed in the hands of \\nthe memb ers on further distribution by the cooperative societies. \\nTherefore, it is proposed to allow the inter -cooperative society \\ndividend income as deduction under the new tax regime to the \\nextent it is further distributed to the members.  \\n(iii) Deduction of dividend income received by a notified national co -\\noperative federation in the new tax regime.  \\n\\uf0b7 It is proposed to allow exemption to dividend income received by \\na notified national federal cooperative from a company for a \\nperiod of three years.

The amendment \\nseeks to enable the Board to make provisions for the \\ncustody of goods imported or to be exported under the \\nregulations framed under this section.  \\nThese changes shall come into effect from date of assent \\nto the Finance Bill, 2026.  \\nA.2     Amendments in the Customs Tariff Act, 1975  \\n(i)  The First Schedule to the Customs Tariff Act, 1975 is \\nbeing amended to, add 148 new tariff entries in chapter \\n03, 08, 12, 13, 20, 21, 22, 25,26, 28, 29, 33, 39, 41, 47, 48, \\n73, 81, 84, 85, 86, substitute/delete 54 tariff entries and \\namend 2 tariff entries in chapter 29 and 1 tariff entry in \\nchapter 85.   \\n(ii) Further the tariff rate on certain tariff items is being \\nmodified with effect from 02.02.2026 and the rates on \\ncertain other tariff items are also being modified as part \\nof rate rationalisation with effect 01.04.2026.  \\n(iii) In respect of various goods, to operationalize effective \\nbasic customs duty rates from First Schedule instead of \\nexemption notifications, new tariff lines have been \\ncreated and the rate of duty for certain existing tariff  52  \\n \\nlines has been amended. This is a simplification exercise \\nand there is no change in the applicable rate of duties on \\nsuch goods.  \\n(iv) New tariff lines are also being introduced to help in \\nbetter identification of the coated pipes for exports, \\ngetting actual transaction data of precursor chemicals \\nand help in their effective monitoring, facilitating, \\ntracking exports and deciding   policy  measures for Plant \\nbased extract products, and providing boost to eco -\\nfriendly industries  \\n(v) For details of the above, the Explanatory Memorandum \\nto the Finance Bill, 2026, may be referred. These changes \\nwill come into effect from 01.05.2026, unless otherwise \\nspecified.  \\nA.3     Amendment to Rules and Regulations under Customs Act, 1962  \\n(i) In addition to the above, new Baggage Rules are being \\nissued for international passengers.  \\n(ii) Deferred duty payment is being made monthly and a \\nnew class of eligible importers is being created by \\namending the existing Deferred Payment of Import Duty \\nRules, 2016.  \\n(iii) Cap on the value of goods exported through courier is \\nbeing removed by amending Courier Regulations.  \\n(iv) Further, to ease e -commerce, the returns and rejects \\nprocedures in courier is being relaxed.  \\n(v) To decongest the courier terminals and to improve the \\noverall efficiencies and ease of import and export, the \\nCourier Regulations are being amended to allow for \\nreturn to origin.  \\nB.
